            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I am Daniel Ding, an aspiring programmer and a professional violinist hoping to share my skills to the world and beyond. And here I will share a few of them.</p>
            <p>I absolutely adore playing chess, even though I only learned how the pieces move when I was 12</p>
            <p>I Play the violin a lot, and even though I am not much of a violinist, I am still the best in my school Orchestra. Im not flexing. I swear. I swear!</p>
            <p>I love programming. Well, love and hate programming, because I like programming by itself and I think that is it cool, but I just hate my coding classes. I do know that I want to major in Computer Science, and shouldn't be slacking like that, but I don't care. I just hate it.</p>
            <p>I also created this website not just to show off my talents, but also to get the collge application staff to be impressed with my work. Hopefully I will get into Stanford.</p>
