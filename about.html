            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Daniel Ding, a passionate programmer, and a professional violinist. My journey combines my love for music and my ambition to master the world of programming. I believe that both fields, while distinct, share a common thread of creativity and precision.</p>
            <p>This website is a reflection of my passions, showcasing my work in both music and programming, as well as other interests like gaming and chess. My goal is to create meaningful projects that bridge my interests and expertise.</p>
