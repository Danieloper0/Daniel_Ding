A website that is built to introduce you to myself and to showcase my talents and knowledge.
Currently I am in 8th grade, Middle School, and I started building this website during early 2020 in hopes of indroducing myself to others which I take pleasure in doing, and to outdue COVID-19.

This website also showcases my skill in programming, which might be useful when I graduate from high school, looking for a splendid university. In that case, I can introduce myself to the addmissions commitee through this website.
Hopefully this website turns out to be successful and I go to a renowned university, then this website will be one of my biggest achievements.

Greetings, from Daniel
